    <h4>About the SIRIUS Project</h4>
    <p>
      The Sustainable Interdisciplinary Research to Inspire Undergraduate Success (SIRIUS) Project aims to provide students majoring in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) with authentic professional learning experiences in the classroom. Our goal is to help each discipline develop and implement classroom experiences that reflect the activities of their working professionals. We have currently redesigned and coordinated scientific investigations in 18 laboratory science courses, all focused on a common theme â€“ the human impacts on the American River Ecosystem that runs through our campus. The SIRIUS Project was developed in the Biology Department and has now expanded to other departments on campus, including Chemistry, Geology and Environmental Studies. Future goals include participation throughout the STEM disciplines at Sacramento State and from our critical education partners at the Los Rios Community College District in Sacramento.
