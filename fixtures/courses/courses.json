        "description": "BIO 1 is the first course taken by freshmen who come to Sac State wanting to study biology. It is an introduction to the properties of life that lead to genetic and biological diversity. The course focuses on biological diversity, variation in organisms that leads to natural selection, an introduction to ecological concepts, and the study of ecosystems, from local to global. The SIRIUS Module in BIO 1 is a study of the impact of fertilizer use on the organisms in the American River, with a focus on invertebrates such as insects, crustaceans and worms. River water and soil are collected into classroom aquaria at the beginning of the semester, the organisms in the aquaria are collected and sampled, varying quantities of fertilizer are placed into the aquaria, and the organisms are collected and sampled a second time after treatment. Students then compare the changes in the samples that result from the treatments. BIO 1 provides an introduction to many skills that will be required in later SIRIUS courses and is the first course in the Toxicology Thread that runs through the SIRIUS Project.",

The SIRIUS Module in BIO 100 is designed to use concepts and data acquired in other SIRIUS courses for the activities listed above. It is a central course that extends all of the SIRIUS Threads through data analysis. Course teams from BIO 1, BIO 2, BIO 127, BIO 139 and BIO 160 are preparing data sets from for the BIO 100 students to use for final projects.

The course examines the progression of fertilized eggs of vertebrate organisms through embryonic development. This progression is studied at biochemical, molecular, genetic, morphological and physiological levels, with an emphasis on the progressive changes that occur within cells, tissues and organs in the embryo. It uses a comparative approach between a variety of model organisms to understand similarities and differences among vertebrate and selected invertebrate species. The SIRIUS Module in BIO 127 builds on the Toxicology Thread begun in BIO 1, and is focused on the impacts of human-derived toxins on the population dynamics of C. elegans nematodes. C. elegans is an extremely well-studied, soil-dwelling worm that can be found in the river environment. Students learn to quantify all stages of worm development, statistically evaluate the impact of the toxin on all stages relative to controls, and to form hypotheses and experimental designs based on their data.",

Students apply fundamental principles of cell and molecular biology, evolution, and ecology to understand the relationships between plant anatomy and plant physiology that have enabled plants to achieve such a high level of success as primary producers on our planet. The SIRIUS Module in BIO 128 involves student investigations of the changes in mycorrhizal fungi diversity at a site on the American River that is undergoing restoration of a stream that feeds into the American. These investigations are part of the Mycorrhizal Fungi Ecology Thread shared by BIO 160 and BIO 180. In Bio 128 students examine plant roots collected at each stage of restoration and stain these to identify the types of mycorrhizal fungi present. These data combined with the species diversity information from Bio 180 will enable students to develop hypotheses regarding the physiological roles of fungi in plant establishment and growth.",

It is focused on classical and molecular approaches to examine fecal coliform bacteria and identify the presence of associated disease-causing factors. Water and soil samples gathered from the American River are: (1) plated on selective and differential media to isolate colony forming units and; (2) added to Colilert broth and Petrifilms for biochemical analysis of metabolic pathways used by fecal coliform bacteria.

The SIRIUS Module in BIO 2 is a cellular and molecular analysis of the impacts of urban run-off on bacterial communities in the soil of the American River ecosystem. The main focus is on soil samples collected from a side channel of the river that receives unfiltered city street run-off. To fully assess the effects of run-off on bacterial abundance and diversity, a site in the main flow downstream of the city outlet and multiple upstream controls are also sampled. Students analyze cell and colony morphology of soil bacteria on agar and prepare DNA samples for further analysis in subsequent SIRIUS courses. BIO 2 also provides an introduction to many skills that will be required in later SIRIUS courses and is the first course in the Bacterial Diversity Thread that runs through the SIRIUS Project.

The SIRIUS Module in CHEM 31 is focused on human impacts on river water quality. Students collect water and soil samples from ecologically relevant locations along the river and use the concentrations of nutrients (such as nitrate and phosphate) to assess the impact of human inputs to the river ecosystem, such as agricultural runoff or storm water (urban runoff). Investigations focus on the combination of this nutrient data with trace level organic molecules that serve as tracers of specific inputs (i.e., caffeine for human wastewater). Other SIRIUS courses will also benefit from these data sets. For example, General Ecology (BIO160) students characterize the fungal diversity of soil samples that vary by ecological location. Chemical data on the soil will improve their analysis by providing greater insight into the conditions that determine the ecological variability.",

Students use existing data to determine the risk of human exposure relative to published concentrations of contaminants in fish caught locally. ENVS 130 is a Lecture/Discussion-based course without a laboratory section, and it is exciting for us to develop a meta-analysis-based CURE to reach students outside of the traditional laboratory classroom, yet in a setting where real-world and real-time data are used to assess environmental and health impacts.",
