It is an introduction to the properties of life that lead to genetic and biological diversity. The course focuses on biological diversity, variation in organisms that leads to natural selection, an introduction to ecological concepts, and the study of ecosystems, from local to global. The SIRIUS Module in BIO 1 is a study of the impact of fertilizer use on the organisms in the American River, with a focus on invertebrates such as insects, crustaceans and worms. River water and soil are collected into classroom aquaria at the beginning of the semester, the organisms in the aquaria are collected and sampled, varying quantities of fertilizer are placed into the aquaria, and the organisms are collected and sampled a second time after treatment. Students then compare the changes in the samples that result from the treatments. BIO 1 provides an introduction to many skills that will be required in later SIRIUS courses and is the first course in the Toxicology Thread that runs through the SIRIUS Project.",
